<head>  <title>Partner Alert: Changes to Checkout API Coming Soon</title>
</head>
<body>


<p>  We are excited to share an early announcement that BigCommerce will soon be releasing a public Checkout API and accompanying JavaScript SDK. These updates will give developers more access to customizing checkout than ever before.</p>



  <p><b> What Partners Need to Know</b></p>



  <p> To prepare for the release, our BigCommerce Engineering team will be making changes to the APIs used by checkout. We plan to release an update in the coming weeks to Partner Sandboxes that will transition you from our internal API to the public Storefront Checkout APIs. We don’t expect an impact on most Partner stores, unless your app hooks into our current Checkout API. </p>



<p>   We encourage Partners to use this week as a testing period to ensure your app is unaffected by changes to checkout functionality.</p>



<p>  <b> About Checkout API & JS SDK</b></p>



<p>   Coming soon -- our Checkout API will allow developers to build a completely custom front-end for the checkout page, creating an experience tailored to the needs of diverse businesses. We’re also releasing a software development kit to make it easier to create your own checkout.</p>



<p>   The SDK is a JavaScript library that encapsulates the low-level logic of talking to the public Storefront Checkout API. Stores on Enterprise-level plans will be able to replace the checkout page with a completely custom front-end using these tools.</p>



  <p> Moving forward, we’ll be sharing more information about Checkout APIs and the Checkout SDK as we approach the release. In the meantime, if you have any questions feel free to ask them in the comments below.</p>
